# 📂 Majoor Assets Manager for ComfyUI

Fast asset browser for ComfyUI outputs with native OS metadata.

Majoor Assets Manager is a UI extension (no custom nodes) to browse, inspect, and organize images, videos, audio, and 3D exports without leaving ComfyUI. It runs asynchronously and writes ratings/tags directly to your files' Windows properties (with ExifTool/JSON sidecar fallback), so your organization survives outside of ComfyUI.

---

## Prerequisites / System Requirements

- ExifTool is recommended for video metadata (MP4/MOV/M4V/WEBM/MKV). Without it, video workflows/prompts can fall back to a degraded scan and some embedded metadata may be missed.
- Windows: download from exiftool.org and ensure `exiftool.exe` is on your PATH.
- macOS: `brew install exiftool`
- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl`
- ffprobe is used when available; timeouts are configurable via `MJR_META_FFPROBE_TIMEOUT` and `MJR_META_EXIFTOOL_TIMEOUT`.
- Additional safety timeouts:
  - `MJR_EXIFTOOL_READ_TIMEOUT` (default: `2`)
  - `MJR_EXIFTOOL_PRESERVE_TIMEOUT` (default: `3`)
  - `MJR_EXIFTOOL_WRITE_TIMEOUT` (default: `3`)
  - `MJR_FILE_MANAGER_TIMEOUT` (default: `15`)

## Scalability (Large Libraries)

- The file listing endpoint supports pagination: `GET /mjr/filemanager/files?offset=0&limit=500` (omit `limit` to return everything for backward compatibility).
- Frontend page size can be tuned via settings key `grid.pageSize` (default: `500`).

---

## Development (Formatting)

This repo uses `ruff` for consistent Python formatting (and a small set of safe autofixes).

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
ruff format .
ruff check --fix .
```

Optional (recommended): enable pre-commit hooks so formatting runs automatically before commits.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ Async, cached scans: non-blocking backend, virtualized grid, lazy metadata fetch, auto-refresh, and queue listener so new renders show up quickly.
- 🏷️ Native ratings & tags: edit 0-5 ratings and tags that sync to Windows Explorer; ExifTool or JSON sidecars on Linux/Mac; badges on cards and in the viewer.
- 🔎 Prompt/workflow inspector: view prompts, seed, sampler, CFG, checkpoint, LoRAs, and parsed workflow. Video parsing scans common comment/description/parameters tags via ffprobe/ExifTool and can reconstruct a workflow from a prompt graph when needed. Sibling PNG fallback is used if video metadata is empty.
- 🧭 Filters, search, collections: search bar, type filter (image/video/audio/3D), min rating, tag filter, smart views (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, 4+/5, Videos, Images), and custom collections stored in `_mjr_collections`.
- 🖼️ Viewer + A/B compare: lightbox viewer with filmstrip nav, zoom/pan, video/audio playback, rating HUD, and side-by-side slider compare for two selected files.
- 🗂️ Sibling-aware metadata: detects PNG companions for videos/audio/3D to reuse metadata; open in Explorer, delete/send to trash, and add to collections from the context menu.
- 🧲 Clean drag & drop: dragging any asset exposes standard `text/uri-list` and `DownloadURL` (when supported) for ComfyUI and external targets; drops on the ComfyUI canvas are handled natively by ComfyUI (no workflow import/interception by this plugin).

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo-url> ComfyUI-Majoor-AssetsManager
   ```
3. Install Python requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ComfyUI-Majoor-AssetsManager/requirements.txt
   ```
4. Restart ComfyUI.

## 🎹 Hotkeys

Hotkeys are ignored while typing in an input/textarea.

### Assets Manager (grid)

- `0`-`5`: set rating for the current file (0 clears).
- `Space`: open viewer (1 selected) or A/B compare (2 selected; uses the first two).

### Viewer

- `Esc` or `Space`: close viewer.
- `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight`: previous/next asset (when navigation is enabled).
- `0`-`5` (including numpad): set rating (when rating hotkeys are enabled).
- `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown`: step videos +/- 1/30s (when frame-step hotkeys are enabled).
- `F`: fit/reset view.

---

## ℹ️ Notes

- Windows uses native shell metadata; Linux/Mac fall back to ExifTool or JSON sidecars (`.mjr.json` and `_mjr_collections` live in your output folder).
- Drag & drop: dragging from the grid uses standard `text/uri-list` and `DownloadURL` (when supported). Drops on the ComfyUI canvas are handled natively by ComfyUI (this plugin does not import/open workflows on drop).
- No custom nodes are added; the manager runs entirely in the UI and the REST API under `/mjr/filemanager/*`.
